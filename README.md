# MyPortfolio

Hey! This is my **first portfolio project**, showing off my skills in building **clean, functional, and responsive web pages** using React and Tailwind CSS.  

## What’s Inside
- **React** for building components  
- **Tailwind CSS** for sleek, modern styling  
- **TypeScript** for type safety  
- **Vite** for fast development  

## About
This is **Task 1** of my portfolio journey. It’s all about creating a solid foundation for my web projects and showing what I can do as a frontend developer.  

Check it out, explore the code, and see the design in action!
